- Setting up behavioral triggers

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites for Production

- Configure email provider rate limits
- Set up proper database indexing
- Enable webhook signature verification
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Set up backup and recovery procedures

### Performance Considerations

- The system processes emails in configurable batches (default: 50 per batch)
- Rate limiting prevents overwhelming email providers
- Cron jobs run at optimized intervals to balance performance and resource usage
- State cleanup prevents data bloat over time
