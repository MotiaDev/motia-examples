# Motia Framework Overview

Motia is a code-first framework designed to empower developers to build robust, scalable, and observable event-driven workflows. It supports JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Ruby.

## Key Features

- Zero infrastructure setup - no need to configure message queues or event brokers
- Multi-language support: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Ruby
- Built-in observability through Motia Workbench
- Out-of-the-box API endpoints and scheduling capabilities
- Visual flow representation and debugging

## Core Concepts

1. **Steps**: Self-contained, reusable units of business logic
2. **Flows**: Logical groupings of related steps to accomplish specific tasks
3. **Events**: Messages that flow between steps
4. **Topics**: Named channels for events, enabling routing and decoupling

## Step Types

1. **Event Step**: Reacts to events, processes data, and emits new events
2. **API Step**: Exposes HTTP endpoints to trigger workflows
3. **Cron Step**: Schedules tasks to run at specific intervals
4. **NOOP Step**: Represents virtual points where external actions occur

## Step Structure

Every step consists of:
1. Configuration (`config` object) - defines metadata and event routing
2. Handler function - contains the business logic

## Motia Workbench

The built-in development platform that provides:
- Interactive flow visualization
- Real-time testing
- Live log streaming
- Development tools and debugging features
