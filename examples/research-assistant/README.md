## üîß Implementation Details

This agent leverages Motia's powerful event-driven architecture with the following steps:

### API Endpoints
- `uploadPaper`: Receives paper metadata and initiates the analysis workflow
- `queryConcepts`: Query the knowledge graph by concept
- `queryPaper`: Retrieve paper details by ID
- `serveCss`: Serves stylesheet for the UI
- `serveStatic`: Serves static files for the UI

### Analysis Pipeline
- `extractText`: Extracts text from paper (simulated in this demo)
- `analyzePaper`: Performs initial analysis using Gemini 2.5 Pro
- `analyzePaperWithGemini`: Enhances analysis with structured information
- `generateSummary` & `generateSummaryWithGemini`: Creates concise, well-structured summaries
- `extractConcepts` & `extractConceptsWithGemini`: Identifies key concepts with descriptions
- `analyzeRelatedLiterature`: Places paper in broader research context
- `analyzeResearchGaps`: Identifies unexplored areas and future research opportunities
- `evaluateResearchImpact`: Assesses significance and potential implications
- `generateCodeExamples`: Creates practical implementation examples
- `recommendRelatedPapers`: Finds related papers from internet searches
- `researchMonitor`: Monitors the flow of research paper processing (NOOP)
- `paperUploadWebhook`: Handles paper upload events (NOOP)
- `humanReview`: Simulates human review process (NOOP)

### Knowledge Management
- `buildKnowledgeGraph` & `buildEnhancedKnowledgeGraph`: Maintains connections between papers and concepts
- `generateMarkdownReport`: Creates readable reports from the knowledge graph

### Technical Components

- **Event System**: The application uses Motia's event-driven architecture where components communicate through events. Each step subscribes to specific events and emits new events upon completion.

- **NOOP Steps**: "No Operation" steps that don't perform actual processing but serve as placeholders or monitoring points in the workflow. Examples include:
  - `researchMonitor`: Monitors the research paper processing flow
  - `paperUploadWebhook`: Acts as an event handler for paper uploads
  - `humanReview`: Simulates human review process integration

- **Gemini Integration**: Robust integration with Google's Gemini AI that includes:
  - JSON parsing and error handling
  - Text extraction with regex patterns
  - Direct extraction of structured data

- **UI Components**: The system includes a simple web interface for:
  - Paper upload
  - Result visualization
  - Knowledge graph exploration
  - Report generation

The implementation uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model for all AI tasks, with robust error handling and case-insensitive key processing to ensure reliability. The knowledge graph is stored using file-based persistence in a JSON file, making it accessible across different steps and API endpoints.

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üåê API Endpoints

### Upload a Paper
```http
POST /api/upload-paper
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example payload:
```json
{
  "title": "Mem0",
  "authors": "Prateek Chhikara, Dev Khant, Saket Aryan, Taranjeet Singh",
  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.",
  "pdfUrl": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19413",
  "doi": "2504.19413"
}
```

Example response:
```json

  "paperId": "paper-1746292138955"
}
```

### Query Knowledge Graph
```http
GET /api/query
```

Query options:
```http
GET /api/query                           # Get all data
GET /api/query?concept=Mem0              # Query by concept

// Using Node.js built-in fetch API (available in Node.js v20+)

async function testUploadPaper() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/upload-paper', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
